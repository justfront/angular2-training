# Passing in data 


So we have this wonderful application, but it only handles static data at the moment.
How would we make it work with a more dynamic list of states?

What we need is a state component that has a name property.

Generate the state


```bash
$ ng generate component usa/state
installing component
  create src\app\usa\state\state.component.css
  create src\app\usa\state\state.component.html
  create src\app\usa\state\state.component.spec.ts
  create src\app\usa\state\state.component.ts
  update src\app\app.module.ts
```

Lets modify the state component to have an input


```typescript
import { Component, 
         OnInit, 
         Input // <-- Added
        } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-state',
  templateUrl: './state.component.html',
  styles: [`
   p {
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: yellow;
     }
  `]
})
export class StateComponent implements OnInit {

  @Input() name: string; // <-- added Input annotation

  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit() {
  }

}
```

and the corresponding template as well.

```html
<p>
  {{name}} works! 
</p>
```

(add the css

## One-time String initialization with @Input
The input will be used as part of the directive to create a state.

So..to pass it in, lets edit the USA template

```html
<p>
  This is the USA component.
  <app-texas></app-texas>
  <app-pennsylvania></app-pennsylvania>
  <app-state name="Florida"></app-state>
</p>
```

We can now pass the name into the component.

This is what is known as a one-time string initialization.

We use one-time string initialization to pass a string constant into a child component, but only once during start up. 


So now we see florida.

## Property binding

We can also bind component properties with the square brackets.

Lets modify the usa component some more

```javascript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-usa',
  templateUrl: './usa.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./usa.component.css']
})
export class UsaComponent implements OnInit {
  favorite = "California";
  others = ["Nevada", "Oregon", "Utah","Oklahoma"];
  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit() {
  }
}
```

if we change the input to a property binding, we get this:
```html
  <app-state [name]="favorite"></app-state>
```

and now we see California

## ngFor

One last change.  We will address the built in directives later. But lets just throw one in to close this out.

We changed our usa component to have an _others_ property. This was a list of state names.
We can update our template to render this list of state components. To do this, we will use *ngFor, which
will iterate over a list of items and generate a new tag for each one. Hereâ€™s what our new template
will look like:

```html
<p>
  This is the USA component.
  <app-texas></app-texas>
  <app-pennsylvania></app-pennsylvania>
  <app-state [name]="favorite"></app-state>
  <app-state *ngFor="let stateName of others" [name]="stateName"></app-state>
</p>
```

This is similar to the ng-for loop in angular1.

## Files
Include in this directory is the final version of the exercise.
Assuming you have typescript and angular cli installed, you should be able to just use npm update to use it.
