# App component

So there are several file all over the place. Some are configuration, some for webpack, but the one we want to look at
is the /app directory.

In there we have app.component.ts

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'app works!';
}
```
 
All this was generated by the CLI.  It knows what to import and does the skeleton code for the application, css, html and testcase.

The exported class AppComponent is basically what was the controller.  In Angular 1.5, they started the module concept and moved away from 
adding values to the $scope and instead use the value in the javascript object itself.  The selector is what we used to identify the
directive in angular1.  The app component would be used by simply inserting <app-root></app-root> in you html.

The templateURL and and styleUrls point to files that have the template and css code. This could be used to specify inline code as well.



Lets add to this. We will add two more properties to the AppComponent. This is similar to adding to the scope in angular.


```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'app works!';
  title2 = 'Go Angular';
  title3 = 'Its your birthday';
}
```

Once you save...check out the shell. Its compiling on the fly.

The templateUrl points to the html template that belongs to this component.  It can be written inline or reference another file.

The styleUrls are a list of css files.  It can also be be just _styles_ and be a list of css strings.  Or you can have both  :)


```html
<h1>
  {{title}}
</h1>
```

The part with the  {{ }}  is what is called a template tag. Angular2 will use interpolation to evaluate the contents of
the curly brackets. It will replace that name with the string value of the component property in the component.

You can evaluate all kinds of things here, but for now..lets just stick to a property reference.

Lets modifiy our template to say.

```html
<h1>
  {{title}} - {{title2}} - {{title3}}
</h1>
```

and that turned out as silly as expected.

## Component CSS files

We can tweak the app.component.css file to add some css classes

```css
.color1 {
    color: blue;
}

.color2 {
    color: red;
}

 .color3 {
    color: green;
}
```


```html
<h1>
  <span class="color1">{{title}}</span> - <span class="color2">{{title2}}</span> - <span class="color3">{{title3}}</span>
</h1>
```

# Adding another component

Lets add some components here.
TODO - Explain the nesting

Lets create four components to just demonstrate a simple organization of components.
<app-usa></app-usa>
<app-texas></app-texas>
<app-dallas></app-dallas>
<app-pennsylvania></app-pennsylvania>

Pro tip!
Take advantage of name spacing as much as you can. In this case, angular-ci is prepending app in front of the components. This is the default prefix.
When angular-bootstrap was first introduced, their directives had matching names with standard items as well ("popup", "dropdown" and such).
At some point this cause a mess of collisions and they renamed it all to uib-popup, uib-dropdown and so on.
So to avoid this, you do want a unique prefix as well.  This is an option in the angular cli command. (see --prefix)

If your curious, take a peek in angular-cli.json. You will see the prefix entry there.


```bash
$ ng generate component usa
installing component
  create src\app\usa\usa.component.css
  create src\app\usa\usa.component.html
  create src\app\usa\usa.component.spec.ts
  create src\app\usa\usa.component.ts
  update src\app\app.module.ts
```

Edit the following. 
edit the usa.component.css to add a border

```css
p {
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: green;
}
```
usa.component.html

```html
<p>
  This is the USA component
</p>
```


Now finally, reedit the app.component.html

```html
<h1>
    <span class="color1">{{title}}</span> - <span class="color2">{{title2}}</span> - <span class="color3">{{title3}}</span>

	<div>
	 <app-usa></app-usa>
	</div>
</h1>
```

# Add other components.

Create the other components

```bash
$ ng generate component usa/texas
installing component
  create src\app\usa\texas\texas.component.css
  create src\app\usa\texas\texas.component.html
  create src\app\usa\texas\texas.component.spec.ts
  create src\app\usa\texas\texas.component.ts
  update src\app\app.module.ts

Stave@St-PC MINGW64 ~/interlegis/ang2/nghello/my-project (master)
$ ng generate component usa/texas/dallas
installing component
  create src\app\usa\texas\dallas\dallas.component.css
  create src\app\usa\texas\dallas\dallas.component.html
  create src\app\usa\texas\dallas\dallas.component.spec.ts
  create src\app\usa\texas\dallas\dallas.component.ts
  update src\app\app.module.ts

Stave@St-PC MINGW64 ~/interlegis/ang2/nghello/my-project (master)
$ ng generate component usa/pennsylvania
installing component
  create src\app\usa\pennsylvania\pennsylvania.component.css
  create src\app\usa\pennsylvania\pennsylvania.component.html
  create src\app\usa\pennsylvania\pennsylvania.component.spec.ts
  create src\app\usa\pennsylvania\pennsylvania.component.ts
  update src\app\app.module.ts
```

## Student exercise

Edit the css and and html so that.

   * usa is top component
   * usa contains Texas and Pennsylvania
   * Texas has a red border, penn has the blue.
   * Dallas is purple and within Texas
   
Your results should look like this

## Inline templates and css.

Lets mess with Texas.
Rather than use the stylesUrls, we can add a styles propery to the @Component instead.  We can do this for the template as well.

edit the @Component in texas.component.ts as follows:

```html
@Component({
  selector: 'app-texas',
  template: `
          <p>
             Dont mess with Texas!
            <app-dallas></app-dallas>
          </p>   `,
  styles: [`
   p {
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: red;
     }
  `]
})
```
