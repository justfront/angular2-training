# Typescript

What is it?
> A typed superset of Javascript that compiles to plain Javascript.

> TypeScript is a compile-to-JavaScript language that brings compile-time type checks, 
> classical object-oriented programming patterns, and powerful typing features to JavaScript.

There are actually plenty of languages out there that are supsets of Javascript.  There has got to be something that is missing?

Transpiled Languages Add Features

> One substantial advantage to transpiled languages is that they can add features. 
> This is one of TypeScript's main selling points, as it adds interfaces, abstract classes, algebraic data types, 
> and other features to JavaScript, which we wouldn't be able to use otherwise.

> The transpiled language implements a feature in raw JavaScript, 
> and lets you work with the interface without having to worry about the details. 
> Truth is, we do this even when we write normal JavaScript: We still use ES6-to-ES5 
> transpilers to write to use JavaScript's newest features, since the relatively small number of 
> people using browsers with reliable ES6 support is . . . Well, people like us.

So we get stronger type checking, which leads to less bugs, and more confidence in our refactorings.

So why does angular2 use Typescript?

Google was going to have its own Language "AtScript" to include the features they wanted on top of vanilla js.
But they teamed with Microsoft and got what they wanted in the language.
