Code examples from the session


*Simple* is a simple http exercise

*http-wiki* demonstrates a look head style text book using the wikipedia api.

If you have Angular-cli and typescript installed, you should be able to install this with just _npm install_.


Note http-wiki is fixed for angular 2.4.5 as there were some bugs in 2.4.6 and 2.4.7 related to Json
